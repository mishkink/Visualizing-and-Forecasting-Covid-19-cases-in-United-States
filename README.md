Covid-19 is a contagious respiratory and vascular disease. For most nations this has proved to be a great threat in terms of Health and economy. Due to its easy transmission through air, small droplets, aerosols, it has become the most widespread disease in recent times. In order to forecast the future spreading and effects of this disease, it is also important to understand the patterns of disease spread in different states in the United states till now. This project uses visualizations to help describe differences in disease spread in different states with different weather conditions, differences in state policies due to covid-19 impact and predicting the future disease spread. Of the various aspects analyzed in this analysis, the number of policy changes in different parts seems to be a significant factor.
